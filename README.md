# House-price-analysis-and-prediction-using-machine-learning
This repository contains the code and data for a housing price prediction model using various techniques.

**Project Goals:**
Develop a model to predict housing prices based on relevant features (e.g., area, location, city).
Explore and compare different algorithms for performance and suitability.
Provide a well-documented and easily reproducible environment for housing price prediction analysis.

**Data:**
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksondivakarr/house-price-prediction-dataset

**Technology Stack:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (depending on algorithms used)

**Getting Started:**

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-price-prediction.git
Open a Jupyter notebook in the notebooks directory and run the cells.

**Disclaimer:**
The model predictions are for informational purposes only and should not be solely relied upon for real-world decisions.
The results may vary depending on the specific data and market conditions.
